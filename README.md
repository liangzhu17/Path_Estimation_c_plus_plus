These programs are about my master thesis "Investigation of probabilistic Multi-Object Tracking methods for vehicle tracking in aerial observations", the implementation of which is in [Labeled Multi-Bernoulli Tracker](https://github.com/liangzhu17/Labeled-Multi-Bernoulli-Tracker).

This program was originally done in python, but I rewrite part of it in C++ out of interest. Please see my python version in the link above for more information.

This programm can estimate the occluded path length of a driving vehicle. The first method approximate the path to be a part from an arc.

The second method approximates the path to be a B-Spline.
